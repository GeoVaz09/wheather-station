# Weather Station
This project is designed to monitor and display the temperature and humidity levels in your home. It leverages the capabilities of an ESP8266 microcontroller and a DHT11 sensor to gather real-time environmental data. The data is then transmitted wirelessly to a Flask-based web server, where it is visually presented on a user-friendly dashboard.

With this setup, you can easily keep track of your homeâ€™s climate conditions from any device connected to your network, ensuring a comfortable and safe living environment.
